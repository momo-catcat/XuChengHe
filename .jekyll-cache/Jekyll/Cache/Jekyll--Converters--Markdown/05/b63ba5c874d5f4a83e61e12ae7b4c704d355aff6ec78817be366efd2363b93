Without any doubt, they are complementary: observations tell us the reality, experiments and theories explain the mechanisms and models help to predict the past and future. I have always been charmed by the possibility to combine several of these methods to look at a problem from different angles – a way I believe that will tell us the most about the importance of an atmospheric phenomenon.</h5>

My research combines state-of-art mass spectrometric methods with quantum chemical calculations, laboratory experiments, field observations and models of different scales to help achieve molecular understandings of these scientific questions.</h5>

These methods commonly only measure one, or very few iodine species at a time. This hinders us from underderstanding atmospheric iodine chemistry and particle formation in detail.</h5>

I tested this idea as a part of my <a href="https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/229173">Master’s thesis</a> project and it returned a surprise! This method not only detects most of the gaseous iodine species simultaneously but also comes with an unprecedented sensitivity! We further developed this method to detect iodine species both in the gaseous and particular phases with <a href="https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/4187/2021/">two mass spectrometers</a>. This method later leads to the first <a href="http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2009951118">online detection of hypoiodous acid (HOI)</a>, the largest inorganic iodine emission globally.</h5>
