- title: "Role of iodine oxoacids in atmospheric aerosol nucleation"
  image: IOAP_mechanisms.png 
  description: Iodine species are one of only a handful of atmospheric vapors known to make new aerosol particles, which play a central role in controlling the radiative forcing of climate. He et al. report experimental evidence from the CERN Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets, or CLOUD, chamber demonstrating that iodic acid and iodous acid rapidly form new particles and can compete with sulfuric acid in pristine regions.

- title: "Determination of the collision rate coefficient between charged iodic acid clusters and iodic acid using the appearance time method"
  image: IA_clusters.png 
  description: Ions enhance the formation rate of atmospheric aerosol particles, which play an important role in Earth’s radiative balance. Although theoretical frameworks exist to calculate the collision rate coefficients between neutral molecules and ions, they need to be experimentally confirmed, ideally under atmospherically relevant conditions of around 1000 ion pairs cm<sup>-3</sup>$. Here, in experiments performed under atmospheric conditions in the CERN CLOUD chamber, we have measured the collision rate coefficients between neutral iodic acid (HIO<sub>3</sub>) monomers and charged iodic acid molecular clusters containing up to 11 iodine atoms. Three methods were analytically derived to calculate ion-polar molecule collision rate coefficients.

- title: "Measurement of iodine species and sulfuric acid using bromide chemical ionization mass spectrometers"
  image: BrCIMS_peaks.png 
  description: Iodine species are important in the marine atmosphere for oxidation and new-particle formation. Here, we describe the application of a bromide chemical ionization mass spectrometer (Br-CIMS) to measure iodine species. We have measured gas-phase iodine species and sulfuric acid using two BrCIMS. From offline calibrations and intercomparisons with other instruments, we have quantified the sensitivities of the Br-MIONCIMS to HOI, I<sub>2</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and obtained detection limits of 5.8 × 10<sup>6</sup>, 3.8 × 10<sup>5</sup>, and 2.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> molec. cm<sup>−3</sup>, respectively, for a 2 min integration time.

- title: "Direct field evidence of autocatalytic iodine release from atmospheric aerosol"
  image: ICl_aerosol_surface.png 
  description: The postulation that heterogeneous cycling of reactive iodine on aerosols may significantly influence the lifetime of ozone in the troposphere not only remains poorly understood but also heretofore has never been observed or quantified in the field. Here, we report direct ambient observations of hypoiodous acid (HOI) and heterogeneous recycling of interhalogen product species (i.e., iodine monochloride [ICl] and iodine monobromide [IBr]) in a midlatitude coastal environment. Significant levels of ICl and IBr with mean daily maxima of 4.3 and 3.0 parts per trillion by volume (1-min average), respectively, have been observed throughout the campaign. We show that the heterogeneous reaction of HOI on marine aerosol and subsequent production of iodine interhalogens are much faster than previously thought.
