# Research
##### There are several ways to study atmospheric composition: field observations, laboratory experiments, physical chemistry and models of different scales. Without any doubt, they are complementary: observations tell us the reality, experiments and theories explain the mechanisms and models help to predict the past and future. I’ve always been charmed by the possibility to combine several of these methods to look at a problem from different angles – a way I believe that will tell us the most about the importance of a problem. 

##### My past and current research has a central theme: understanding the particle formation in polar and marine environments, with a special focus on the role of iodine species in atmospheric particle and cloud condensation nuclei formation processes. My research combines state-of-art mass spectrometric methods with kinetic modeling, quantum chemical calculations and laboratory experiments to help solve this question.

##### Some of the major challenges in iodine particle formation studies before I started were:

##### -There wasn’t a technique that could provide sensitive and comprehensive measurements of gaseous iodine species.

##### -The aerosol nucleation mechanism wasn’t clear.

##### -The importance of iodine particle formation processes remains unclear.

##### I try to contribute to solving the central theme starting from small steps:

##### One of the key challenges in atmospheric iodine studies is that there are few methods that can measure iodine species at atmospherically relevant levels. These methods commonly only measure one, or very few iodine species at a time. This hinders us from underderstanding atmospheric iodine chemistry and particle formation in detail. 

##### Inspired by earlier works utilising the iodine chemical ionisation method to detect chlorine and bromine species, I started wondering: why not instead try to use bromine to detect iodine? I tested this idea as a part of my [Master's thesis](https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/229173) project and it returned a surprise! This method not only detects most of the gaseous iodine species simultaneously but also comes with an unprecedented sensitivity! We further developed this method to detect iodine species both in the gaseous and particular phases with [two mass spectrometers](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/14/4187/2021/). This method later leads to the first [online detection of hypoiodous acid (HOI)](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.2009951118), the largest inorganic iodine emission globally.
